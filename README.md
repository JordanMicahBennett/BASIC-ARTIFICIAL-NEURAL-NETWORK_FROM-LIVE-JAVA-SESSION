  Why?: This is practice writing of basic neural network from memory. I do this at the end of each year, or sometimes every 6 months, for practice of fundamentals. ([See other neural networks that  I've written.](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/NEURAL_NETWORK_PRACTICE))

  The problem space is [X-OR inputs]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_gate). So the model does xor input prediction.
  
  Given two numbers in [X-OR space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_gate), the model will try to guess the output.
  
  For:
  
  a) Input=(0,0) output should be 0
  
  b) Input=(1,0) output should be 1
  
  c) Input=(0,1) output should be 1
  
  d) Input=(1,1) output should be 0
